            GWP'S concern for the well-being of students is amply reflected in its arrangement for a holistic campus life. The institution has two hostels for girls on campus. Designed aesthetically, all hostels have been built to ensure comfortable stay with air & light aplenty. The pastoral surrondings give the campus, especially the hostel, an ideal ambience to lead a life of health & to help the students concentrate on their studies.
        </p>
        <p>To give the boarders a homely feeling and a breathing space only a specified number of students are accomodated in each room. All these help the students to spend their hostel life in harmony with themselves and those around them. WE also provide a seprate bed for each student,two celling fan, four table & chair in each room.</p>
        <p>GWP hostel are not only safe and comfortble but also cheap given the spirailing trend in house rent in and around Ranchi.</p>
        <p>The food stuff served at the hostel ha been to be of a very high standard. Special food items are served on special occasions and a grand feast is arranged at the end of every mouth. Meticulous care is taken towards sanitary requirements and cleanliess of the hostels and their surrondings. Hygine is of paramount importance here and is maintained in right earnest.</p>
